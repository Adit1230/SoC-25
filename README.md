Over the course of this project, I have learnt about arrays, sorting, time complexity, space complexity, two pointers method, number theory, modular arithmetic, pattern matching, recursion, classes, pointers, linked lists, stacks, queues and bitwise operations. I also explored binary trees, tree traversals, divide and conquer techniques, greedy algorithms, and basic computational geometry. In the later weeks, I studied graphs in depth, including breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and connected components. I further learnt about shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford, minimum spanning trees using Kruskal’s and Prim’s algorithms and disjoint set union (DSU). Finally, I was introduced to 1D and 2D dynamic programming, tries, segment trees, bitmask dynamic programming, and range query techniques.
